## Movie Search - UCSD Ext. Full Stack Boot Camp Activity
This is a simple website that explores the use of APIs. This was an activity that we worked on in class that I wanted to redo and share with friends so that they can use it to get information about their favorite movies, movies they may be interested in, or simply to use for trivia night.

## Version/Dev Notes
2.4.2020 This current version is a simple, no design, bare-bones site for now that I am using to reinforce the lessons that we went over in class. For future version/s, I hope to add a little more styling to this and possibly add it to my portfolio because who doesn't enjoy a great movie?
